# Analytics Tools

The following guide lists platforms you can use to gather analytics and setup customizations about OP Mainnet.

## Blocknative

[Blocknative](https://www.blocknative.com/) lets you [decode](http://docs.blocknative.com/ethernow/batch-decoder-api) and [analyze](https://docs.blocknative.com/blocknative-data-archive/blob-archive) OP Stack Batches submitted to the Ethereum L1. You can inspect, analyze, decode, and download the data of any batch – confirmed on-chain or not – via public APIs or visually through the [Ethernow Explorer](http://ethernow.xyz). Below you can find links to the different resources:

*   [Batch Decoding API](http://docs.blocknative.com/ethernow/batch-decoder-api): decode OP Stack Batch transactions into its human-readable, JSON format.
*   [Blob Archive API](https://docs.blocknative.com/blocknative-data-archive/blob-archive): take any versioned hash of an OP Stack Blob and receive the blob data (even beyond the 4096 epoch window of storage).
*   [Mempool Archive](https://docs.blocknative.com/blocknative-data-archive/mempool-archive): Analyze any OP Stack transaction that was in the Ethereum mempool to see detection time, time pending, gas, etc.
*   [Ethernow explorer](http://ethernow.xyz): Visually see transactions and batches enter the mempool and get organized into blocks. Use this filter to see OP Stack Batches enter the mempool and land on-chain.

## Tenderly

[Tenderly](https://tenderly.co/) monitoring stack lets you [inspect any transaction execution on OP Mainnet or OP Sepolia](https://docs.tenderly.co/debugger#how-to-use-tenderly-debugger).

You can inspect the state of your verified contract in any step of the transaction's execution, as well as step into or over function calls.
The level of detail the Tenderly dashboard presents will reduce your development time as well as help you understand the execution flow of transactions.
It helps you to inspect states at every instance of transaction and gives a platform to trace transactions. You can also simulate pending (or any other historical) transactions and see their exact outcomes.

*   [setup real-time alerts for smart contracts](https://blog.tenderly.co/how-to-set-up-real-time-alerting-for-smart-contracts-with-tenderly/)
*   [automate your responses to alert triggers](https://blog.tenderly.co/tenderly-alert-webhooks/) with custom webhooks

## Dune Analytics

[Dune Analytics](https://dune.com) allows anyone to create dashboards that present information about OP Chains (OP Mainnet, Base, and Zora are available). See [Dune Docs](https://dune.com/docs/) for more info.
You can find a list of community created dashboards for OP Chains [here](https://dune.com/browse/dashboards?q=tags%3Aop%2Coptimism%2Csuperchain\&order=trending\&time_range=24h), or [create your own](https://docs.dune.com/#queries) dashboard.

Here are some of our favorite dashboards so far:

*   [OP Chains / Superchain - L2 Activity, Chain Economics](https://dune.com/oplabspbc/op-stack-chains-l1-activity)
*   [OP Chains / Superchain - Popular Apps & Project Usage Trends](https://dune.com/oplabspbc/superchain-op-chains-apps-and-project-usage-trends)
*   [By OP Chain - L2/L1 Chain Economics](https://dune.com/oplabspbc/optimism-l2-l1-economics)
*   [OP Token House Delegates](https://dune.com/optimismfnd/optimism-op-token-house)
*   [Superchain NFTs](https://dune.com/oplabspbc/superchain-nfts)

## Shadow
[Shadow](https://shadow.xyz) lets you add new event logs to any deployed smart contract to generate custom onchain data for realtime indexing and analytics. You can ingest shadow event logs via
[JSON-RPC](https://docs.shadow.xyz/getting-data/json-rpc), or [stream decoded data](https://docs.shadow.xyz/getting-data/database-syncs) directly to your database. This allows you to write an
onchain indexer entirely in Solidity, save engineering time, and ship faster.

Some benefits that Shadow enables:
*   Deeper contract data coverage (net-new events)
*   Simple data pipelines (write an indexer in Solidity in minutes)
*   Faster iteration cycles (make data-driven decisions)
*   Gasless logging (add offchain events to any existing contract)

Shadow supports OP Mainnet and Base, and can onboard new OP Stack rollups in less than 48 hours. See the [Shadow docs](https://docs.shadow.xyz/) to learn more.
